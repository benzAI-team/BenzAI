# Some use cases of BenzAI

We describe several use cases that we use to produce some figures of our article "BenzAI: A Program to Design Benzenoids with Defined Properties Using Constraint Programming" published in JCIM.


## A basic generation of the benzenoids having six hexagons and a mirror symmetry

The first use case deals with the generation of the first four benzenoids having six hexagons and a mirror symmetry.

First, we go to the menu Input and choose the entry Generator.

We impose as the first criterion that the number of hexagons is equal to six. Then we define a second criterion related to the symmetry and a third one in order to limit the number of solutions to four.

Finally, we run the generation and obtain the first four desired benzenoids (among eleven).
